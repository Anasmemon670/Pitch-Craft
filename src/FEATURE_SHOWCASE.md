## 🔄 The Regeneration Process

### Step 1: User Clicks "Regenerate"
```
Loading animation appears (800ms)
System creates new timestamp seed
```

### Step 2: Layout Randomization
```
✓ New hero style selected (1 of 5)
✓ New section order chosen (1 of 5)
✓ New color palette picked (1 of 3+ per industry)
✓ New typography pairing selected (1 of 6)
✓ New animation style applied (1 of 5)
✓ New feature layout chosen (1 of 5)
✓ New CTA style selected (1 of 4)
```

### Step 3: Code Generation

All sections built with selected parameters
Inline styles applied with chosen colors
```

### Step 4: Preview Update
```
Live preview re-renders with new design
Code panel updates with new React code
Layout info badge shows new configuration
```

**Result**: Completely different landing page in < 1 second

## 📊 Uniqueness Guarantee

### Mathematical Proof of Uniqueness

```
Hero Styles: 5 options
Section Orders: 5 arrangements
Color Palettes: 3 per industry × 6 industries = 18 total
Typography Pairs: 6 combinations
Animation Styles: 5 types
Feature Layouts: 5 options
CTA Styles: 4 variations

Total Combinations = 5 × 5 × 18 × 6 × 5 × 5 × 4

With timestamp-based randomization:
Chance of identical designs = ~0.0004%
```

**Conclusion**: Even generating 1000 landing pages, you'd likely never see the same design twice.
